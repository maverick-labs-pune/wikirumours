            Misinformation and disinformation pose a challenge to development, governance, public health, and human
            security efforts around the world. WikiRumours is a workflow and technology platform designed to counter the
            spread of false information through transparency and early mitigation of conflict.

        <p class="mt-10 text-md md:text-xl  ">
            As communications technology has become more widely distributed in the developing world, the spread of
            inaccurate, incomplete or fabricated information is an increasingly significant threat to peace and
            stability, particularly in regions with limited access to reliable third-party media.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-10 text-md md:text-xl ">
            WikiRumours can be used to contextualize and mitigate misinformation through community involvement, crisis
            moderation, and transparency.
